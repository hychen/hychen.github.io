Property-based tests make statements about the output of your code based on 
the input, and these statements are verified for many different possible inputs.

- There and back again
- Some things never change
- The more things change, the more they stay the same
- Solve a smaller problem first
- Hard to prove, easy to verify
- The test oracle
