* Remapping Keyboard Keys On Mac
** Gloal
1. Remaps capslock to Ctrl.
2. Remaps casplock to Escape.
** Why
1. I am a fan of *Emacs* but prefer *VIM style editing* (which leads me to start using spacemacs), 
   I'll use *Ctrl* and *Escape* very very often. 
2. The default layout of Mac keyboard does not work very well to me.
3. Capslock is useless, I never use it. Luckly, it seems a good place to put *Ctrl/Escape* there.
** Remaps Capslock To Ctrl
1. Go into the Keyboard preference pane. 
2. Click "Modifier Keys…", and change Caps Lock to Control.
3. Download the lastest version of [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en][Seli]].
4. Open Seli and go *other keys* section to Change *Ctrl_L*
** Remaps Capslock to Escape
1. Download the lastest version of [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/][Karabiner]].
2. go into Karabiner and search for this option:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Control_L to Control_L
      (+ when you type Control_L only, send Escape)
#+END_VERSE
