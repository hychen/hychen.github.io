      <description>Inspired by An Emacs Blogging Workflow, I choose Hugo + Emacs as my blogging platform.
Hugo is a static site generator. It natively supports org-mode, builds fast, and has live reloading.
deploy-blog will goto your blog content, run hugo, cleanup old html, and push the updates.
start-blog-server will run hugo server if not already running, and open the webpage in your browser.
My blog workflow is then to startup the server (SPC a a), write some content in org-mode and see it reflected in the browser on each save, and deploy (SPC a b).</description>

      <description>Managing Dotfiles In Org-Babel I used to have almost 80% configurations that I stole from other people on the internet which are never used. Why? Maybe because I did not think why I need them, those things just did not be adopted in my daily workflow.
org-babel is a way that you can embed your code block in your literature. I&#39;ve ever seen people use it to manage their Emacs configuration many times, and think it might be easy to manage my dotfiles also.</description>
